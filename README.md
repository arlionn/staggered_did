# staggered_did

The folder contains a Stata project that uses a simulated dataset and estimates event studies using TWFE OLS and recently developed estimators: `csdid`, `did2s`, `eventstudyinteract`, `did_multiplegt`, `did_imputation`, `stackedev`. For further details on these estimators, see https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/Diff-in-Diff-Notes/blob/main/README.md.

It suffices to download the entire folder, open `staggered.stpr` and run `0.run_file.do`. There is no need to adjust paths, nor downloading the user-written packages as they are already contained in `stata_packages`.
