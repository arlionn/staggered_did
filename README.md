# staggered_did

Simulated example illustrates how to estimate causal effects with event studies using a range of methods

The code uses a simulated dataset and estimates event studies using the following estimators: TWFE OLS, `csdid`, `did2s`, `eventstudyinteract`, `did_multiplegt`, `did_imputation`, `stackedev`.
